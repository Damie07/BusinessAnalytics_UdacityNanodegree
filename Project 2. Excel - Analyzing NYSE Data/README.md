<h1> Analyzing NYSE Data </h1>  

<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>  

In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. You will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project. We used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

**Why this Project?**  
In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.  

**What skills will I use?**  
The main goal of this project is for you to demonstrate your ability to:
- interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
- use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).
- analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
- create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.  

For the final project, you will conduct three Tasks:

1) Complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings.  
2) Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.  
3) Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.  

You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming which sub-category and company you want to focus your data analysis on the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to conduct your analysis and choose a sub-category and company you are most interested in. This project is open-ended in that there is no one right answer.

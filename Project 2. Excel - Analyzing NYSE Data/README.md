2) Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement.  
3) Create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.  

You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming which sub-category and company you want to focus your data analysis on the questions leading to this page should have assisted in this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to conduct your analysis and choose a sub-category and company you are most interested in.
